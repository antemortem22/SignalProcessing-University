The purpose of both scripts was given by an universitary paper. I'm (or was) studying sound engineering. 
The objective of them was to process audio in real time, recorded by a microphone. I had several problems with the compatibility of PyAudio for the fact that is no longer in maintenance, so the last version was updated in 2017.
To complement I've added many libraries like MathPlotLib, PySimpleGUI, Numpy, etc. They were necessary to create a simple and understandable interface. 
I couldn't make a very functional program due to lack of time, that's why I made two scripts focused differently; one on precision (Exact_mic) and the other in complexity(Complex_mic). The first one has more sensitivity in receiving audio and the second one is less precise but has more data.
